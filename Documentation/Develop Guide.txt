## Development Strategy and Roadmap for WPDispatchForge

### **Development Strategy**

1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Develop the plugin as a collection of modules to ensure updates and fixes in one feature set do not break others.
   - Core modules:
     - **PackScan Workflow**
     - **Takealot Sync**
     - **MultiSync Pro**
     - **Break-Apart Products**
     - **Grouped Products**
     - **Shipping Integrations**
   - Use hooks, filters, and shortcodes for extensibility.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Utilize default WooCommerce tables wherever possible.
   - Add custom tables for connected platform API keys, settings, and mappings.
   - Ensure relationships between tables for products, orders, and platforms are optimized for query performance.

3. **API Management**:
   - Implement a centralized API manager for handling integrations with Takealot, WooCommerce, and other platforms.
   - Use the WordPress REST API structure for seamless integration.
   - Enable real-time sync with retry mechanisms for error handling.

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Leverage WordPress and WooCommerce UI frameworks for consistency.
   - Add tabs and sections in the product and order pages for platform-specific fields.
   - Provide inline tooltips and contextual help for new features.

5. **Role-Based Permissions**:
   - Define roles for Admin, Store Manager, and Clerk with access control for different plugin features.

6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Develop unit tests for API integrations and stock management logic.
   - Conduct stress testing for handling large datasets (e.g., 10,000+ products or orders).
   - Include logging for API calls, sync processes, and workflow events.
