## Development Strategy and Roadmap for WPDispatchForge

### **Development Strategy**

1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Develop the plugin as a collection of modules to ensure updates and fixes in one feature set do not break others.
   - Core modules:
     - **PackScan Workflow**
     - **Takealot Sync**
     - **MultiSync Pro**
     - **Break-Apart Products** (Complete)
     - **Grouped Products**
     - **Shipping Integrations**
   - Use hooks, filters, and shortcodes for extensibility.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Utilize default WooCommerce tables wherever possible.
   - Add custom tables for connected platform API keys, settings, and mappings.
   - Ensure relationships between tables for products, orders, and platforms are optimized for query performance.

3. **API Management**:
   - Implement a centralized API manager for handling integrations with Takealot, WooCommerce, and other platforms.
   - Use the WordPress REST API structure for seamless integration.
   - Enable real-time sync with retry mechanisms for error handling.

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Leverage WordPress and WooCommerce UI frameworks for consistency.
   - Add tabs and sections in the product and order pages for platform-specific fields.
   - Provide inline tooltips and contextual help for new features.

5. **Role-Based Permissions**:
   - Define roles for Admin, Store Manager, and Clerk with access control for different plugin features.

6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Develop unit tests for API integrations and stock management logic.
   - Conduct stress testing for handling large datasets (e.g., 10,000+ products or orders).
   - Include logging for API calls, sync processes, and workflow events.

### **Roadmap**

  - Add support for Origin Order Number.
- **MultiSync Pro Enhancements**:
  - Expand admin panel for connected site management.
  - Enable bidirectional sync with improved order tracking.

#### **Phase 3: Advanced WooCommerce Features (Weeks 7-10)**
- **Break-Apart Products** (Complete):
  - Key fields:
    - `_total_parents`: Number of full parent products in stock.
    - `_total_parent_units`: Remaining individual units from partially used parent products.
    - `_parent_units`: Number of units in one full parent product.
    - `_total_units`: Total number of units available across `Total Parents` and `Total Parent Units`.
    - `_child_units`: Number of parent units required to create one child product.
    - `_child_shelf_stock`: Pre-made child products available on shelves.
    - `_child_parent_stock`: Possible stock of the child product derived from the parent product.
    - `_stock`: Default WooCommerce stock field, dynamically updated to combine `Shelf Stock` and `Possible Stock`.

#### **Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (Weeks 15-16)**
- Conduct unit, integration, and stress testing for all features.
- Optimize database queries and API calls for performance.
- Finalize error handling and logging mechanisms.

#### **Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation (Weeks 17-18)**
- Prepare deployment package and install on test environments.
- Create user guides and technical documentation for API and plugin usage.
- Deploy to live environments and monitor for initial feedback.

#### **Phase 7: Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)**
- Add support for additional platforms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon, eBay).
- Implement advanced reporting and analytics dashboards.
- Explore mobile app integration for workflow management.

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

#### **Step 1: Setup Development Environment (Week 1)**

3. Define plugin folder structure for modular development (e.g., subfolders for core modules, assets, and utilities).

#### **Step 2: Database Schema Design and Creation (Week 1)**
1. Use the WooCommerce schema where applicable.
2. Create custom tables for additional fields like connected site mappings, break-apart attributes, and platform-specific data.
3. Write migration scripts for database setup.

#### **Step 3: Admin Panel Framework (Week 2)**
1. Develop a settings page for API keys, synchronization intervals, and platform configurations.
2. Add a dashboard with a summary of sync statuses, errors, and system health.

#### **Step 4: Core Module Development (Weeks 3-6)**
1. **PackScan Workflow**:
   - Implement picking and packing logic.
   - Build SKU scanning and validation functionality.
   - Add reporting and status updates to WooCommerce orders.
